# Grammar_Checking
A Machine Learning / AI project which uses Deep Learning techniques, Python 3 and the PyTorch library that can detect a misused word in its context of appearance and propose the correct alternative.

For instance, consider the words “their”, “they’re” and “there” which are pronounced almost the same. People learning English as a Second Language (ESL students) have trouble sometimes using the correct instance of these homophones.

Take the following correct sentences:
* There they saw something extraordinary, far exceeding what they knew.
* Their knowledge of those facts was incomplete.
* They’re going to learn something new from the ML course.
  
It is easy to obtain incorrect sentences out of these:
* They’re they saw something extraordinary, far exceeding what they knew.
* There knowledge of those facts was incomplete.
* Their going to learn something new from the ML course.
